<!--
Inheritance:
By default, most CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their children. 
The font-family and font-size properties defined on the body element are inherited by
its child elements (h1, p, and the div).

Specificity:
Specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS rule is applied when there are
conflicting styles. The .override-font class has a more specific style for font-family
and font-size, so it will override the inherited styles for elements with this class.
