// Traditional "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript
console.log("Hello, World!");

/*
   Explanation of the tradition:
   
   "Hello, World!" is a classic and simple program used as the first example when 
   learning a new programming language. It serves several purposes:
   
   1. Simplicity: "Hello, World!" is a very simple program, which helps beginners 
   focus on the basic syntax and structure of a new language.
   
   2. Familiarity: Since this program is used so frequently, it's easy to compare 
   and contrast how different languages handle the same task. This makes it a 
   useful tool for language comparison and evaluation.
   
   3. Testing: It's a great way to test if your development environment is set up 
   correctly and that you can run code successfully in a new language. If you can 
   make "Hello, World!" work, you're on the right track.
   
   4. Tradition: Over time, it has become a tradition and a shared experience 
   among programmers to start their journey in a new programming language with 
   "Hello, World!"
